# RideLink ðŸš—

A decentralized ride-sharing escrow system built on Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts with integrated dispute resolution and dynamic surge pricing.

## Overview

RideLink enables secure, trustless ride-sharing transactions between riders and drivers through smart contract escrow. The platform ensures fair payment processing while maintaining transparency and security for all parties involved. Now featuring a comprehensive dispute resolution system with staked mediators and intelligent dynamic pricing based on real-time supply and demand metrics.

## Features

- **Secure Escrow System**: Funds are held in smart contract until ride completion
- **Dynamic Surge Pricing**: Intelligent fare adjustment based on real-time supply and demand
- **Rating System**: Drivers can be rated by riders to build reputation
- **Flexible Cancellation**: Both parties can cancel rides under appropriate conditions
- **Platform Fee Management**: Automated fee collection for platform sustainability
- **Transparent Transactions**: All ride data stored on-chain for transparency
- **Dispute Resolution System**: Staked mediators can resolve conflicts between riders and drivers
- **Mediator Staking**: Arbitrators must stake tokens to participate in dispute resolution
- **Multi-Party Voting**: Disputes resolved through mediator consensus with stake-based incentives
- **Location-Based Analytics**: Real-time tracking of demand and supply metrics per location
- **Surge History Tracking**: Historical pricing data for analytics and optimization

## Dynamic Pricing Algorithm

The platform implements a sophisticated surge pricing mechanism that adjusts fares based on:

### Supply & Demand Metrics
- **Active Requests**: Number of pending ride requests in a location
- **Available Drivers**: Number of drivers ready to accept rides
- **Demand Ratio**: Real-time calculation of requests vs available drivers

### Surge Multipliers
- **Base Rate**: 1.0x (no surge)
- **Low Demand**: â‰¤3 requests per driver (no surge)
- **Medium Demand**: 3-10 requests per driver (moderate surge)
- **High Demand**: â‰¥10 requests per driver (maximum surge up to 5.0x)

### Dynamic Adjustments
- Real-time pricing updates based on location-specific metrics
- Automatic driver availability tracking
- Historical surge data for pattern analysis

## Usage

### For Riders
1. Call `estimate-fare` to get current pricing with surge
2. Call `request-ride` with pickup location, destination, and base fare
3. System automatically applies current surge multiplier
4. Wait for driver to accept via `accept-ride`
5. Track ride progress through status updates
6. Rate driver after completion using `rate-driver`
7. If issues arise, use `raise-dispute` to initiate dispute resolution

### For Drivers
1. Register availability using `register-driver-availability` for specific locations
2. Monitor available rides using `get-ride` and `get-current-surge`
3. Accept rides using `accept-ride` (automatically removes from available pool)
4. Start ride with `start-ride`
5. Complete ride and receive payment via `complete-ride`
6. Re-register availability or move to new location
7. If issues arise, use `raise-dispute` to initiate dispute resolution

### For Mediators
1. Register as mediator using `register-mediator` with required stake
2. Monitor active disputes
3. Vote on disputes using `vote-on-dispute`
4. Earn rewards for accurate dispute resolution
5. Maintain stake to remain active in the system

## Dynamic Pricing Examples

### High Demand Scenario
```
Location: "Downtown"
Active Requests: 15
Available Drivers: 2
Demand Ratio: 7.5
Surge Multiplier: 2.75x
Base Fare: 1000 STX â†’ Final Fare: 2750 STX
```

### Low Demand Scenario
```
Location: "Suburbs"
Active Requests: 2
Available Drivers: 5
Demand Ratio: 0.4
Surge Multiplier: 1.0x (No Surge)
Base Fare: 1000 STX â†’ Final Fare: 1000 STX
```

## Dispute Resolution Process

1. **Dispute Initiation**: Either party can raise a dispute within 24 hours of ride completion
2. **Mediator Assignment**: Active mediators can vote on the dispute
3. **Voting Period**: 48-hour window for mediators to cast votes
4. **Resolution**: Majority vote determines outcome (refund to rider vs payment to driver)
5. **Stake Distribution**: Winning voters share rewards, losing voters lose portion of stake

## Contract Architecture
