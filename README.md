# RideLink ðŸš—

A decentralized ride-sharing escrow system built on Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts with integrated dispute resolution, dynamic surge pricing, and multi-token payment support.

## Overview

RideLink enables secure, trustless ride-sharing transactions between riders and drivers through smart contract escrow. The platform ensures fair payment processing while maintaining transparency and security for all parties involved. Now featuring a comprehensive dispute resolution system with staked mediators, intelligent dynamic pricing based on real-time supply and demand metrics, and support for multiple payment tokens including STX and SIP-010 tokens.

- **Dynamic Token Pricing**: Real-time exchange rate management for supported tokens
- **Dynamic Surge Pricing**: Intelligent fare adjustment based on real-time supply and demand
- **Rating System**: Drivers can be rated by riders to build reputation
- **Flexible Cancellation**: Both parties can cancel rides under appropriate conditions
- **Platform Fee Management**: Automated fee collection for platform sustainability
- **Transparent Transactions**: All ride data stored on-chain for transparency
- **Dispute Resolution System**: Staked mediators can resolve conflicts between riders and drivers
- **Mediator Staking**: Arbitrators must stake tokens to participate in dispute resolution
- **Multi-Party Voting**: Disputes resolved through mediator consensus with stake-based incentives
- **Location-Based Analytics**: Real-time tracking of demand and supply metrics per location
- **Surge History Tracking**: Historical pricing data for analytics and optimization
- **Token Analytics**: Track payment volume and usage statistics per token

## Multi-Token Payment System

### Supported Payment Options
- **STX**: Native Stacks token (default)
- **SIP-010 Tokens**: Any compliant fungible token
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Automatic conversion rates relative to STX
- **Real-time Updates**: Token prices can be adjusted by platform owner

### Token Management Features
- Add new payment tokens with custom exchange rates
- Update token prices based on market conditions
- Deactivate/reactivate tokens as needed
- Track payment volume and usage per token
- Automatic conversion calculations for fare estimation

### Payment Flow
1. Platform owner adds supported tokens with STX-relative pricing
2. Riders select preferred payment token when requesting rides
3. Smart contract automatically calculates fare in chosen token
4. Escrow holds tokens until ride completion or dispute resolution
5. Drivers receive payment in the same token used by rider

## Dynamic Pricing Algorithm

The platform implements a sophisticated surge pricing mechanism that adjusts fares based on:

### Supply & Demand Metrics
- **Active Requests**: Number of pending ride requests in a location
- **Available Drivers**: Number of drivers ready to accept rides
- **Demand Ratio**: Real-time calculation of requests vs available drivers

### Surge Multipliers
- **Base Rate**: 1.0x (no surge)
- **Low Demand**: â‰¤3 requests per driver (no surge)
- **Medium Demand**: 3-10 requests per driver (moderate surge)
- **High Demand**: â‰¥10 requests per driver (maximum surge up to 5.0x)

### Dynamic Adjustments
- Real-time pricing updates based on location-specific metrics
- Automatic driver availability tracking
- Historical surge data for pattern analysis
- Token-specific fare calculations with exchange rate conversions
