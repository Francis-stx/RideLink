# RideLink ðŸš—

A decentralized ride-sharing escrow system built on Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts.

## Overview

RideLink enables secure, trustless ride-sharing transactions between riders and drivers through smart contract escrow. The platform ensures fair payment processing while maintaining transparency and security for all parties involved.

## Features

- **Secure Escrow System**: Funds are held in smart contract until ride completion
- **Rating System**: Drivers can be rated by riders to build reputation
- **Flexible Cancellation**: Both parties can cancel rides under appropriate conditions
- **Platform Fee Management**: Automated fee collection for platform sustainability
- **Transparent Transactions**: All ride data stored on-chain for transparency

## Smart Contract Functions

- `accept-ride`: Driver accepts an available ride request
- `start-ride`: Driver starts the ride journey
- `complete-ride`: Driver completes ride and triggers payment
- `rate-driver`: Rider rates driver after ride completion
- `cancel-ride`: Cancel ride request (conditions apply)

### Read-Only Functions
